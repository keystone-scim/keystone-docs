What's Keystone? Keystone is a fully containerized lightweight SCIM 2.0 API implementation. Whether you're using one of the prominent cloud identity managers such as Azure Active Directory, Okta, Auth0, etc., or another identity provider that supports automatic provisioning with SCIM 2.0, you can use Keystone to quickly store the state of directory in a data store . Hello, again! Supported Data Store As Keystone is an entirely stateless workload, it expects you to bring your own storage layer, and it'll take care of the nitty-gritty details, such as schema and tables creation. All you have to do is provision a supported data store in a network location that your Keystone container can reach. Keystone currently supports the following data stores: Azure Cosmos DB PostgreSQL (version 10 or higher) MongoDB (version 3.6 or higher) An in-memory store for testing purposes only . Keystone is slated to support the following data stores, in descending order of implementation priority: Azure AD B2C Tenants MySQL Redis Microsoft SQL AWS DynamoDB Supported Authentication Methods While the SCIM 2.0 protocol itself doesn't define SCIM-specific scheme for authentication , most prominent identity managers allow you to specify a bearer token that they'll use in the Authorization HTTP header in their requests against SCIM 2.0 APIs. Keystone currently allows you to specify that secret bearer token in two places: In an Azure Key Vault secret. In an environment variable ( AUTHENTICATION_SECRET ).

Keystone will attempt to create its a database container and tables upon startup if they do not yet exist. Please read further to learn how to configure Keystone with an Azure Cosmos DB store. Prerequisites You'll need to ensure the following criteria are met: Keystone can reach Cosmos DB : It may go without saying, but your Cosmos DB account will have to be eachable by your Keystone deployment. If your Cosmos DB account is gated in a VNet, ensure network constraints allow Keystone to work with your Cosmos DB account. Authentication Keystone can authenticate with Cosmos DB in one of the following ways: Managed Identity (highly recommended): In case you're deploying Keystone to a container runtime environment in Azure (e.g., Azure Kubernetes Service , Azure Container Apps ) it is highly recommended to set up a managed identity for the service running the Keystone container(s), and assign RBAC roles that allow it to interact with your Cosmos DB service. Read more on Azure Managed Identities . Account Keys: Cosmos DB allows you to generate account keys with which you can make authenticated Cosmos DB requests. If you opt to use this authentication method, it's recommended that you rotate the Cosmos DB account keys often. Read more on Cosmos DB Account Keys . Example The following YAML file and environment variables is a valid way to configure Keystone to point to your Cosmos DB account as its data store, using an Azure Managed Identity (assuming Keystone runs on azure, e.g., on AKS ). Create a file and call it keystone_config.yaml : store : cosmos : account_uri : https://myscim2pool.documents.azure.com:443/ Run the container, while bind-mounting the configuration file as a volume, along with environment variables for secrets: docker run -it \\ -p 5001 :5001 \\ --mount type = bind,source = \" $( pwd ) \" /keystone_config.yaml,target = /etc/keystone_config.yaml -e AUTHENTICATION_SECRET = \"<extra secret bearer token>\" \\ -e CONFIG_PATH = /etc/keystone_config.yaml ghcr.io/keystone-scim/keystone:latest Running on Azure? Use Azure Key Vault If you're using Azure, you can leverage Azure Key Vault to store Keystone 's bearer token. If you set up a managed identity for Keystone to consume secrets from an Azure Key Vault, your configuration could look like so: store : cosmos : account_uri : https://myscim2pool.documents.azure.com:443/ authentication : akv : vault_name : my-akv-name secret_name : my-bearer-token-secret-name If you're using AKV, don't forget to omit the AUTHENTICATION_SECRET environment variable from the container.","title":"Cosmos DB Store"},{"location":"azure-cosmos-db/#azure-cosmos-db-store","text":"","title":"Azure Cosmos DB Store"},{"location":"azure-cosmos-db/#overview","text":"You can configure Keystone to point to an Azure Cosmos DB service.

Before You Begin Choose How to Confiugre the Container Keystone can be configured in one of two ways: YAML File : A YAML configuration file mounted as a volume onto the container. The path to your configuration YAML file needs to be specified in the CONFIG_PATH environment variable. Environment Variables : All of the configuration keys can be represented with environment variables. You can configure Keystone with either of the two or with a combination of the two, but it is recommended to avoid storing secrets in a YAML file.
